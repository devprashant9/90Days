# 90 Days To Master Data Structures and Algorithms Using [Java🔥] 🚀

> 👉 I am currently in my 4th semester of MCA course. I need to study for that too. Also, need to clear backlog of 1 subject of semester 3rd. Since, I don't have any **Internships** I need to showcase a **Major Project** in practical exams. I am also doing **MERN** alongside.

## Foundation Journey😁

Today is `18-03-2025` and untill `31-03-2025` I will be covering all the basic concept of _Data Structures and Algorithms_ so that I can start my actual journey faster. Within these `14` days I will be touching evry DSA topics along with `Collections and Generics` and `Object Oriented Programming` so that my primary focus remains on DSA.

> 👉 First of all my foundational coding skills are good and from past few days I have been exploring Data Structures and Algorithms. I know basics of **Recursion**, **Binary Search**, **Arrays**, **Strings**, **OOPS**, **Time and Space Complexity**, etc. In short, many of the concepts are known to me so my progress may seem faster.

### Day 1 [18-03-2025] | [10Hrs]

According to the `AlgoPrep` playlist, I directly started with `Arrays` and solved the questions in **Video 1** and they were very basic. The **Video 2** also consisted of few problems that taught me handful of concepts. [2Hrs]

Next, it was time to `Practise` coding questions from `College Wallah`. The **First 2 Videos** were just about basic concepts of array and how to play around with it. Standard problems were covered from **Video 3** onwards.

From **Video 4** onwards focus was given towards _Space and Time Complexity_ along also how to handle _Edge Cases_ which may lead to unexpected error. It also focused on `How to Proceed a Problem` i.e. _Brute Force -> Better -> Optimal -> Complexity_. Only 2 questions were covered _Rotate Array By K Places_ and _Check Whether Number is Present in Array or Not For Q Queries_. The concept learnt in the first question was `Two Pointers Approach` and in second was `Hashing` or you can say **Lookup Array Elements in O(1) Time**.

The **Video 5** was completely dedicate to `Two Pointers Approach` problem and also I got to learn a handful of new concepts. It also discussed about the different approach of proceeding the same problem.

The **Video 6** also consisted good level question related to `Prefix Sum` and it gave me the idea to build logic for the question by doing _Hit and Trail With Multiple Inputs_ and then _Finding a Common Pattern_.

After completing **1D Array**, I started with the next video on AlgoPrep i.e. with `2D Arrays` and started of with basics. Basically in 2D Array problems you play along indices and once you get familiar how the indices changes in different iteration then you can solve handful of problems.

After that I directly went to practise questions from College Wallah. I solved plenty of problems like _Sum of Matrix_, _Product of Matrix_, _Transpose of Matrix_, etc. It gave me a boost to my confidence and felt highly motivated. After that I practised some logical questions like _Rotate By 90 Degress_ and _Pascals Triangle Using Jagged Array_. Next topic included the problems related to **Spiral Format**. And finally ended today's session with a massive problem of `Prefix Sum in 2D Array` and was quite happy.😁

### Day 2 [19-03-2025] | [6Hrs]

Today I started with `Strings` and headed to AlgoPrep and then to College Wallah to cover questions. There was less to know about basics and more to explore about String problems.

The main topics I learn't were, about `Characters` and _How Scanner Class Works While Taking Character Array as Input_. Also, why it causes a error if we don't write `Sc.nextLine()` before input loop. Apart from it the major topic was `String vs String Buffer vs String Builder` and which one to use when. This is because of the performance and space and DSA is all about optiming it. Also difference between **sc.next()** and **sc.nextLine()**.

Completed the whole **Strings** concept in just 3 Hours but the main task of today was to solve ample amount of problems on String and applying all the learnt concept. So directly moved on to `LeetCode` for solving and learning new concepts as well.

After going through quite a number of problems, I discovered that _Inbuilt Data Structures_ were necessary to learn before moving on to any other topic. So I started with **Collections in Java** from `Engineering Digest` and will complete it eventually. As of now I thinnk I only need _ArrayList_, _HashMap_ and _HashSet_ and the remaining we will cover eventually. Along with **Collections** I learn't about `Generics` in Java also.

### Day 3 [20-03-2025] | [4Hrs]

Day 2 not went as per my expectation of reading so started of Day 3 with the same topics on **Collections** in java and got a good hold of it after understanding that how they are related with each other. If your learn a single implenetation then the remaining becomes easy because they _extends and implements_ classes and interfaces so majority of the functions become same. **Thread Syncgronization** data structures are not currently required from DSA perspective so skip them.

However, I found it interesting so I will continue learning the **Collection and Map Interface** in more detail. Most importantly you should understand the `Hashing` technique and `collisions` and **How Map Works Internally** because it is a important concept.

Then started with `Bit Manipulation` from AlgoPrep and I previously have covered this topic in detail so I will just get a quick recap and then move on to our next topic. However, the next topic was also covered i.e. `Hashing` but I didn't practise problems on it. I will do it after completeion of 3 more topics i.e. _recursion, searching, sorting_ and since I know them it won't take that much time to complete these topics.

Next topic was `Recursion` and **College Wallah** channel has almost 9 videos on recursion which I will be completing and then we will move on to sorting. But before that obviously I will watch AlgoPrep video. Since I already knew the concepts it went quite easy. For most problems involving recursion `dry run` with _stack_ or _recursion tree_ is mostly important to get the exact flow of the code. Recursion is best understood when yoy dry-run a problem and also identifying base case becomes more logical and makes more sense. Now, it was time to cover problems of recursion from College Wallah channel.

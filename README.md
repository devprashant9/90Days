# 90 Days To Master Data Structures and Algorithms Using [Java🔥] 🚀

> 👉 I am currently in my 4th semester of MCA course. I need to study for that too. Also, need to clear backlog of 1 subject of semester 3rd. Since, I don't have any **Internships** I need to showcase a **Major Project** in practical exams. I am also doing **MERN** alongside.

## Foundation Journey😁

Today is `18-03-2025` and untill `31-03-2025` I will be covering all the basic concept of _Data Structures and Algorithms_ so that I can start my actual journey faster. Within these `14` days I will be touching evry DSA topics along with `Collections and Generics` and `Object Oriented Programming` so that my primary focus remains on DSA.

> 👉 First of all my foundational coding skills are good and from past few days I have been exploring Data Structures and Algorithms. I know basics of **Recursion**, **Binary Search**, **Arrays**, **Strings**, **OOPS**, **Time and Space Complexity**, etc. In short, many of the concepts are known to me so my progress may seem faster.

### Day 1 [18-03-2025]

According to the `AlgoPrep` playlist, I directly started with `Arrays` and solved the questions in **Video 1** and they were very basic. The **Video 2** also consisted of few problems that taught me handful of concepts. [2Hrs]

Next, it was time to `Practise` coding questions from `College Wallah`. The **First 2 Videos** were just about basic concepts of array and how to play around with it. Standard problems were covered from **Video 3** onwards.

From **Video 4** onwards focus was given towards *Space and Time Complexity* along also how to handle *Edge Cases* which may lead to unexpected error. It also focused on `How to Proceed a Problem` i.e. *Brute Force -> Better -> Optimal -> Complexity*. Only 2 questions were covered *Rotate Array By K Places* and *Check Whether Number is Present in Array or Not For Q Queries*. The concept learnt in the first question was `Two Pointers Approach` and in second was `Hashing` or you can say **Lookup Array Elements in O(1) Time**.

The **Video 5** was completely dedicate to `Two Pointers Approach` problem and also I got to learn a handful of new concepts. It also discussed about the different approach of proceeding the same problem.

The **Video 6** also consisted good level question related to `Prefix Sum` and it gave me the idea to build logic for the question by doing *Hit and Trail With Multiple Inputs* and then *Finding a Common Pattern*.

## Foundation JourneyüòÅ

Today is `18-03-2025` and untill `31-03-2025` I will be covering all the basic concept of _Data Structures and Algorithms_ so that I can start my actual journey faster. Within these `14` days I will be touching evry DSA topics along with `Collections and Generics` and `Object Oriented Programming` so that my primary focus remains on DSA.

> üëâ First of all my foundational coding skills are good and from past few days I have been exploring Data Structures and Algorithms. I know basics of **Recursion**, **Binary Search**, **Arrays**, **Strings**, **OOPS**, **Time and Space Complexity**, etc. In short, many of the concepts are known to me so my progress may seem faster.

### Day 1 [18-03-2025] | [10Hrs]

According to the `AlgoPrep` playlist, I directly started with `Arrays` and solved the questions in **Video 1** and they were very basic. The **Video 2** also consisted of few problems that taught me handful of concepts. [2Hrs]

Next, it was time to `Practise` coding questions from `College Wallah`. The **First 2 Videos** were just about basic concepts of array and how to play around with it. Standard problems were covered from **Video 3** onwards.

From **Video 4** onwards focus was given towards _Space and Time Complexity_ along also how to handle _Edge Cases_ which may lead to unexpected error. It also focused on `How to Proceed a Problem` i.e. _Brute Force -> Better -> Optimal -> Complexity_. Only 2 questions were covered _Rotate Array By K Places_ and _Check Whether Number is Present in Array or Not For Q Queries_. The concept learnt in the first question was `Two Pointers Approach` and in second was `Hashing` or you can say **Lookup Array Elements in O(1) Time**.

The **Video 5** was completely dedicate to `Two Pointers Approach` problem and also I got to learn a handful of new concepts. It also discussed about the different approach of proceeding the same problem.

The **Video 6** also consisted good level question related to `Prefix Sum` and it gave me the idea to build logic for the question by doing _Hit and Trail With Multiple Inputs_ and then _Finding a Common Pattern_.

After completing **1D Array**, I started with the next video on AlgoPrep i.e. with `2D Arrays` and started of with basics. Basically in 2D Array problems you play along indices and once you get familiar how the indices changes in different iteration then you can solve handful of problems.

After that I directly went to practise questions from College Wallah. I solved plenty of problems like _Sum of Matrix_, _Product of Matrix_, _Transpose of Matrix_, etc. It gave me a boost to my confidence and felt highly motivated. After that I practised some logical questions like _Rotate By 90 Degress_ and _Pascals Triangle Using Jagged Array_. Next topic included the problems related to **Spiral Format**. And finally ended today's session with a massive problem of `Prefix Sum in 2D Array` and was quite happy.üòÅ

### Day 2 [19-03-2025] | [6Hrs]

Today I started with `Strings` and headed to AlgoPrep and then to College Wallah to cover questions. There was less to know about basics and more to explore about String problems.

The main topics I learn't were, about `Characters` and _How Scanner Class Works While Taking Character Array as Input_. Also, why it causes a error if we don't write `Sc.nextLine()` before input loop. Apart from it the major topic was `String vs String Buffer vs String Builder` and which one to use when. This is because of the performance and space and DSA is all about optiming it. Also difference between **sc.next()** and **sc.nextLine()**.

Completed the whole **Strings** concept in just 3 Hours but the main task of today was to solve ample amount of problems on String and applying all the learnt concept. So directly moved on to `LeetCode` for solving and learning new concepts as well.

After going through quite a number of problems, I discovered that _Inbuilt Data Structures_ were necessary to learn before moving on to any other topic. So I started with **Collections in Java** from `Engineering Digest` and will complete it eventually. As of now I thinnk I only need _ArrayList_, _HashMap_ and _HashSet_ and the remaining we will cover eventually. Along with **Collections** I learn't about `Generics` in Java also.

### Day 3 [20-03-2025] | [6Hrs]

Day 2 not went as per my expectation of reading so started of Day 3 with the same topics on **Collections** in java and got a good hold of it after understanding that how they are related with each other. If your learn a single implenetation then the remaining becomes easy because they _extends and implements_ classes and interfaces so majority of the functions become same. **Thread Syncgronization** data structures are not currently required from DSA perspective so skip them.

However, I found it interesting so I will continue learning the **Collection and Map Interface** in more detail. Most importantly you should understand the `Hashing` technique and `collisions` and **How Map Works Internally** because it is a important concept.

Then started with `Bit Manipulation` from AlgoPrep and I previously have covered this topic in detail so I will just get a quick recap and then move on to our next topic. However, the next topic was also covered i.e. `Hashing` but I didn't practise problems on it. I will do it after completeion of 3 more topics i.e. _recursion, searching, sorting_ and since I know them it won't take that much time to complete these topics.

Next topic was `Recursion` and **College Wallah** channel has almost 9 videos on recursion which I will be completing and then we will move on to sorting. But before that obviously I will watch AlgoPrep video. Since I already knew the concepts it went quite easy. For most problems involving recursion `dry run` with _stack_ or _recursion tree_ is mostly important to get the exact flow of the code. Recursion is best understood when yoy dry-run a problem and also identifying base case becomes more logical and makes more sense. Now, it was time to cover problems of recursion from College Wallah channel.

---

### Day 4 [21-03-2025] | [5Hrs]

Two main topics to cover today `Sorting` and `Searching` and obviously understanding the `Divide and Conquer` algorithm. From this point of time I will try to code every problem using recursion as much as I can. This is because it will be used on high basis in every topics specially in _Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming_. So practising it daily will develop my mind to build intution about when to think a funtion in terms of **recursion**.

Firstly started today with **Sorting** and we have multiple Sorting techniques available. But when to apply what is major question that arises here. It simply depends when to use what. You can use anything but let me give you a quick scenario.

Assume that you are given a question that involves 3 steps in solving:

- sort the array
- rotate the array
- find maximum

In such cases we can use inbuilt `Arrays.sort(Comparator)` method. The worst case takes **O(N^2)** which is rare but in general we say it as **O(N log N)** and it uses **O(N)** space. The `Comparator` is an interface that helps to order two given values or else sort in ascending order in Java.

Next topic we have is `Binary Search` and most importantly where and when to apply. It is very important to know the application because the implementation is easy. One thing to explore is `Why Dividing in 2 Parts` and **Why Not 3 or 4**. In case of _Merge Sort and Quick Sort_, there also we **Divide Array in 2 Parts**. So just explore this topic by yourself. Also `Binary Search` is applied on `Ordered Array` or `Sorted Array`. Orderd Array can be an array that is not sorted but follows some rule in which they are arranged. Also while calculating mid clear the concept of integer overflow.

Next I practised and solved problems on following topics:

- recursion
- sorting
- searching

### Day 5 [22-03-2025] | [3Hrs]

Started todays day very late and topic to cover today was `Linked List` but it requires `OOPS` knowledge. I already know about fundamentals of these topics but yes revsion is always better. So will be keeping it low.

One thing I am lagging behind is `Problem Solving`. I am able to complete tutorials but unable to solve that many number of problems which is not a good thing becuase this in this way I will end up learning only fundamentals. Also, I need to invest 1 hour of daily to **Collections** to master most frequently used _Data Structures_ of Java. So these remians primary concerns of my main journey. Basically in these 14 days of March I want to take glimpse of all the topics before starting my `90 Days Journey` of DSA with development.

---

### Day 6 [23-03-2025] | [7Hrs]

Started by learning **List Interface** which extends _Collection Interface_. Got know each and every aspect of it starting from _capacity, size, mutability_ to different ways of _creating and sorting a list_. It is important to know any 1 interafce in detail because in majority of the cases they are either extending or implementing **basic methods** which will remain common throught the interface. Thus, only methods we need to remember is the self methods of the interface. Ended the session by understanding **Comparator** in detail. Earlier also I touched this topic but today I understood it in detail with proper understanding.

Next topic to begin with is `Trees`. Earlier when I started to understand Trees it became difficult because I didn't understood recursion but this time things aren't the same. Yes I can get stuck, but this time I will be able to understand by loking at code atleast and by dry running the code just the way I understood **LinkedList** with ease.

While understanding binary tree always focus on dry run of the code. This is because to know the **root** location which simplifies building logic for a problem. When I was doing _Sum of All Nodes_, I was worried about the **data** part but afterwards the solution just struck me. Like the root pointer itself is travelling to all the nodes so why worry about the data part. Just add the **root.data** when it goes to above level after left and right call.

### Day 7 [24-03-2025] | [6Hrs]

From today onwards a major chunk of time will be invested on problem solving also because I have covered up a lot of topic as of now so need to first practise them. I will be refering to `GeeksForGeeks` portal and `450 DSA Sheet` to practise problem. I may not be able to solve at first but the thing is I have now understood the major data structures so it will be easy to understand the code even while looking at solution. Apart from that, there are **algorithms** associated with problem which I need to take care and learn precisely.

Practised quite a few problems and now going to start with `Stack` which is easy we all know the basic working mechanism. The CollegeWallah has almost 3 videos summing upto 10Hrs which I think more than enough to start with as well.

Currently keeping rest of the topics on hold and going to start with `Dynamic Programming With 1D Array` and will also take a look at `Dynamic Programming With 2D Array` to get more familiar with DP. This is because on completing **DP** I will be able to solve problems based on _Two Pointers_ and _Sliding Window_. Also these two approaches mostly includes problem with _Arrays, Strings, Searching, Sorting and DP With 1D_. So a big chunk of topics will get covered. It is just my personal opinion and may not suit to everyone.

---

### Day 8 [25-03-2025] | [7Hrs]

Started today with _Dynamic Programming_ and still looking at its fundamentals for both **Memoization** and **Tabulation** problems. Explored about the difference between _Greedy and DP_ and factors to consider to conclude whether DP can be applied or not.

The next topic was `Sliding Window` which is easy itself but yet complicated. This is a technique based approach and not any algorithm is associated with it. Also, apart from considering this technique also consider the fact that you may use some kind of _Data Structures_ to proceed towards optimal problem.

Solved a handful of problems on _Sliding Window_ and its different types along with variations. One thing I noted is that if you are unable to find solution apart from _Brute Force_ technique then try to use some kind of _Data Structure_ because it will decrease the time complexity. Also, if the question is solvable in O(1) Space then you will must be asked to do it from your interviewer.

By end of the day almost got all the idea and basic fundamentals related to `Sliding Window` and was able to solve basic problems on different variations. No need to practise more and more to get comfortable with all possible variations.

---

### Day 9 [26-03-2025] | [8Hrs]

During initial hours I started to solved mid level questions from arrays and was feeling quite confident then figured out that I have mostly completed all the fundamentals. The remaining topics will be gradually familiar as I start solving more and more problems like `Heaps` and `Backtracking` topics. One thing currently I am missing is `Graph` about which I don't have any idea as of know except for that name.

After practising problems I switched on to learning `Graphs` and will try to get the fundamentals associated with it because it is one of the most asked topics in interview so I must master its basics.

It took me two hours to learn construction of graph and to undestand the storing and fetching mechanism because I coded graph for the first time today. I then explored and got myself into a subtle position and used `ArrayList<ArrayList<Edge>>` for the implementation. Also, graph is represented by various types also which itself is a big deal but after investing 3 hours on I found this way to be the best.

Next I learned both the traversal for graph `BFS and DFS` among which **BFS Traversal** is implement using _Queue_ and **DFS Traversal** can be implemented using _Recursion or Stack_. Also we always need to take a _Visited Array_ to mark the vertices which has been visited once.

# 90 Days To Master Data Structures and Algorithms Using [Java🔥] 🚀

> 👉 I am currently in my 4th semester of MCA course. I need to study for that too. Also, need to clear backlog of 1 subject of semester 3rd. Since, I don't have any **Internships** I need to showcase a **Major Project** in practical exams. I am also doing **MERN** alongside.

## Foundation😁

Today is `18-03-2025` and untill `31-03-2025` I will be covering all the basic concept of _Data Structures and Algorithms_ so that I can start my actual journey faster. Within these `14` days I will be touching evry DSA topics along with `Collections and Generics` and `Object Oriented Programming` so that my primary focus remains on DSA.

> 👉 First of all my foundational coding skills are good and from past few days I have been exploring Data Structures and Algorithms. I know basics of **Recursion**, **Binary Search**, **Arrays**, **Strings**, **OOPS**, etc. In short, many of the concepts are known to me so my progress may seem faster.
